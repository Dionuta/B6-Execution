# B6-Execution

<p>A deep dive into the strange world of JavaScript</p>

<h1>What Was Learned</h1>
 <ul>

  <li>Execution Phase of Execution Context</li>
  <li>Single Threaded - one command at a time.</li>
  <li>Synchronous - one at a time and in order.</li>
  <li>Invocation - running a function</li>
  <li>Execution Stack</li>

 </ul>
 
<h1>Notes</h1>

In the 'Execution Phase' code is run line by line. JavaScript is single threaded and sychronous in it's execution.Execution Stack is once a function is invoked it stacks on to the Global Execution Context.
